Two graduate-level mathematics courses will be offered from August 19 to 31, 2023. Photo credit Details Two courses will be offered: Course 1. Mathematical epidemiology, and Course 2. Data, models, and decision support. Participants will take both courses and receive a grade and certificate of completion that may be used to transfer credit to the home institution. The intended audience for the courses are math graduate students who would like to take these courses for credit. The course is also suitable for undergraduates with an interest in mathematical biology (and who have completed the relevant prerequisite coursework), and advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who are interested in working collaboratively on an innovative project to advance infectious disease modelling. Applicants should have completed undergraduate courses in mathematical modelling, dynamical systems, statistics, and be able to code in R and/or python. From August 20 to 30, 7 hours of work are planned to occur at Bonne Bay Marine Station. Participants should capitalize on being together in one location to work efficiently on projects. Due to the compressed schedule, participants will be asked to complete a problem set prior to arrival on August 19. Instructors Dr. Amy Hurford, Memorial University (Organizer, email: ahurford@mun.ca) Dr. Julien Arino, University of Manitoba Dr. Amy Greer, University of Guelph Dr. Jane Heffernan, York University Dr. James Watmough, University of New Brunswick Guest lecturers Dr. Bouchra Nasri, Universite de Montreal Dr. Steve Walker, McMaster University Dr. Brenda Wilson, Memorial University Dr. Edward Thommes, Sanofi Pasteur Funding Summer school participants will have their accommodation and meal costs covered. Accommodations will be booked for participants. Participants are responsible for organizing their own transportation to Bonne Bay Marine Station. The summer school is supported by the Atlantic Association for Research in the Mathematical Sciences, Mathematics for Public Health, the Canadian Network for Modelling Infectious Diseases, the One Health Modelling Network for Emerging Infections, Memorial University, and the Canadian Centre for Disease Modelling. "],["course1.html", "Course 1. Mathematical Epidemiology", " Course 1. Mathematical Epidemiology This course will cover different formulations and analyses of epidemiological models. Topics include host heterogeneity, multiple pathogens, spatial spread, within-host dynamics, and zoonotic spillover. Some lectures will be based on Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani. Course outline (downloadable .pdf) AARMS Summer School format: 15 lectures (15 hours) 2 guest lectures (2 hours) In-class exercises/group work (18 hours) Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project. Project descriptions will be provided by the instructors. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19. "],["course2.html", "Course 2. Data, models, and decision support", " Course 2. Data, models, and decision support Mathematical models provide decision support through forecasting, describing unrealized past outcomes (counterfactuals), and in communication. This course will teach the technical skills to parameterize dynamical systems models in ecology and evolution, and quantify prediction uncertainty. The course will examine case studies to understand the use of models in decision support.

Participants arriving from mainland Canada may wish to book flights to Deer Lake airport, or may wish to travel on the Marine Atlantic ferry to arrive in Port-aux-Basques. Rental cars are limited and should be booked well in advance. Pittmans taxi is available for transportation from Deer Lake airport to Bonne Bay Marine Station. We will also work to coordinate ground transportation to and from Deer Lake airport for participants.
