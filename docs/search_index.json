Two graduate-level mathematics courses will be offered from August 19 to 31, 2023. Photo credit Applications To apply for the summer school you must complete this form by April 7, 2023. Space is limited. Interested participants are encouraged to apply early so that we can accommodate the maximum number of participants. Details Two courses will be offered: Course 1. Mathematical epidemiology, and Course 2. Data, models, and decision support. Participants will take both courses. A pre-requisite problem set will be assigned to be submitted by August 19. This problem set will cover the preliminaries in dynamical systems, epidemiology, and modelling. From August 20 to 30, 7 hours of work are planned to occur at Bonne Bay Marine Station. Participants should capitalize on being together in one location to work efficiently on projects. Instructors Dr. Julien Arino, University of Manitoba Dr. Amy Greer, University og Guelph Dr. Jane Heffernan, York University Dr. Amy Hurford, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador Dr. James Watmough, University of New Brunswick Funding Summer school participants will have their accommodation and meal costs covered. Accommodations will be booked for participants. Participants are responsible for organizing their own transportation to Bonne Bay Marine Station. The summer school is funded by the Atlantic Association for Research in the Mathematical Sciences, Mathematics for Public Health, the Canadian Network for Modelling Infectious Diseases, the One Health Modelling Network for Emerging Infections, and Memorial University. "],["course1.html", "Course 1. Mathematical Epidemiology", " Course 1. Mathematical Epidemiology This course will cover different formulations and analyses of epidemiological models. Topics include host heterogeneity, multiple pathogens, spatial spread, within-host dynamics, and zoonotic spillover. Some lectures will be based on Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani. Format: 15 lectures (Course 1) 3 guest lectures (both courses) Grading: 8 x problem sets (Course 1) 1 x pre-requisite problem set (both courses) 1 x project (both courses) Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project. Project descriptions will be provided by the instructors. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19. "],["course2.html", "Course 2. Data, models, and decision support", " Course 2. Data, models, and decision support During the COVID-19 pandemic mathematical modelling provided decision support through forecast modelling, exploration of counter-factual scenarios, and guided public communication. This course will teach the technical skills to estimate model parameters, fit models to data, and describe the uncertainty of model predictions. We will explore the use of models in public health communications during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how models provide decision support. Some lectures will be from Ecological forecasting. Format: 15 lectures (Course 2) 3 guest lectures (both courses) Grading: 8 x problem sets (Course 2) 1 x pre-requisite problem set (both courses) 1 x project (both courses) Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project.

"],["getting-there.html", "Getting there", " Getting there The summer school will be held at Bonne Bay Marine Station in Norris Point on the west coast of Newfoundland. Participants arriving from mainland Canada may wish to book flights to Deer Lake airport, or may wish to travel on the Marine Atlantic ferry to arrive in Port-aux-Basques. Rental cars are limited and should be booked well in advance. Pittmans taxi is available for transportation from Deer Lake airport to Bonne Bay Marine Station. We will also work to coordinate ground transportation from airport for participants.
