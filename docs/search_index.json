Two courses will be offered for math graduate credit: Course 1. Mathematical epidemiology, and Course 2. Data, models, and decision support. Participants will take both courses. A pre-requisite problem set will be assigned to be submitted by August 19. This problem set will cover the preliminaries in dynamical systems, epidemiology, and modelling. Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project (1 project for both courses). Ideas for project descriptions will be provided by the instructors. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19. Between the two courses, 7 hours of work is planned each day, expected to occur between 8.30am and 5.30pm with exact times to be determined. Students should also capitalize on being together to work on their projects if they wish, during unscheduled hours. The summer school will feature 3 guest lecturers. 1.3 Instructors Dr. Julien Arino, University of Manitoba Dr. Amy Greer, Guelph University Dr. Jane Heffernan, York University Dr. Amy Hurford, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador Dr. James Watmough, University of New Brunswick 1.4 Guest Lecturers Dr. Brenda Wilson, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador "],["tentative-schedule.html", "2 Tentative schedule", " 2 Tentative schedule 7 hours of work is scheduled August 20-30, with time to spend on projects increasing towards the end of the courses.

Data, models, and decision support", " 4 Course 2. Data, models, and decision support Mathematical modelling best provides decision support when scientists are able to effectively communicate the data support for their recommendations. This involves understanding the models most appropriate for given questions, model assumptions, and communicating uncertainty. This course will cover types of models and what models can be used for, model parameterization and assumptions, forecasting, and model evaluation. We will explore case studies where modelling has informed decision support. Some lectures will be from Ecological forecasting. Lecture 1. What is a model? What are models used for? (conceptual, mechanistic, statistical; strengths of each; forecasting and counterfactuals. Chapter 1 of Otto and Day? Other references?) Lecture 2. Compartmental model assumptions (approximations: GillespieSSA pair approximation). Agent-based models vs. branching processes. Limitations of different approaches. Problems 1. Write 3-4 paragraphs to explain what is meant by ‘all models are wrong but some are useful’. Include an example of a model that is useful. Identify ways in which models that are useful are wrong in different ways than models that are not useful. Lecture 3. Mechanistic models. Introduction to independent parameter estimation (rate parameters as reciprocals of mean time), overview of data sources available. Lecture 4. Ch 2. Process error vs. observation error (and Ch. 6.1 and 6.2 of Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals) Problems 2. Critical review of parameter estimates in modelling papers. Lecture 5.
