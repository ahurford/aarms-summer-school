Two graduate-level mathematics courses will be offered from August 19 to 31, 2023. Photo credit Details Two courses will be offered: Course 1. Mathematical epidemiology, and Course 2. Data, models, and decision support. Participants will take both courses and receive a grade and certificate of completion that may be used to transfer credit to the home institution. The intended audience for the courses are math graduate students who would like to take these courses for credit. The course is also suitable for undergraduates with an interest in mathematical biology (and who have completed the relevant prerequisite coursework), and advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who are interested in working collaboratively on an innovative project to advance infectious disease modelling. Applicants should have completed undergraduate courses in mathematical modelling, dynamical systems, statistics, and be able to code in R and/or python. From August 20 to 30, 7 hours of work are planned to occur at Bonne Bay Marine Station. Participants should capitalize on being together in one location to work efficiently on projects. Due to the compressed schedule, participants will be asked to complete a problem set prior to arrival on August 19.

This may be: a presentation of your project that you upload to a website; software (i.e., hosted on github) or a dataset; a web app (i.e., R Shiny); a website aimed to communicate your results to the public; you may indicate that you plan to continue working on your project and publish it as a pre-print and submit it for peer-review; You must also complete a written project so that we can evaluate the technical details of your work. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19.

Possible projects A guide for infectious disease models aimed to provide decision support Forecasting sampled tick abundance Conditions for forming and suspending the Atlantic bubble Investigating the conditions for locally transmitted dengue infections Simulating the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 Leprosy and Biological Invasion Behaviour change in an epidemic "],["bubble.html", "Conditions for forming and suspending the Atlantic bubble Background", " Conditions for forming and suspending the Atlantic bubble For this project you are to develop a mathematical model that gives the criteria for when a jurisdiction implementing a containment strategy should enter into a quarantine-free `bubble’ during a pandemic. It may be helpful to first consider a two-patch model before considering a more realistic multi-patch model. You may also gain insight by trying to determine the epidemiolgical and public health response requirements for a containment strategy to be possible/beneficial. A relevant reference is The differential importation risks of COVID-19 from inbound travellers and the feasibility of targeted travel controls: A case study in Hong Kong by Yang et al (2021). You should begin by performing a literature review to identify any relevant modelling. Another version of this project would be to consider an infectious disease that impacts agriculture, such as foot-and-mouth, and to review the use of spatially-structured measures, and zones with no measures. Background In the Summer and Fall of 2020, the provinces of Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) reported few COVID-19 cases (Hurford et al. 2023). These provinces formed the Atlantic bubble, which eased COVID-19 self-isolation requirements for residents of Atlantic Canada travelling between provinces. It was announced that the Atlantic bubble would reform in the summer of 2021, but this reopening was delayed, and shortly after most of Canada’s provinces announced re-opening plans because many Canadians had now received at least one dose of vaccine. Wikipedia has a good summary of the Atlantic bubble during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the Trans-Tasman bubble was formed between Australia and New Zealand, with New Zealand proposing the traffic light system to Continue, Pause, or Suspend participation in the bubble. "],["prepcoding.html", "Preparation for students with limited coding experience", " Preparation for students with limited coding experience Coding involves some knowledge of specific languages (for the summer school this is R), however the most important coding skill is having a good idea for how to do what you want to do (i.e., writing pseudo-code), having experience solving similar problems (the summer school aims to give you this experience for your own future research), and being skilled at debugging. If you don’t feel confident with your coding, I recommend being open to learning from a fellow summer school participant that is strong at coding - this is how many of us learned. If you want to learn more R functions, you can complete the software carpentary modules, or consult my R guide (there are other similar guides that might be better), but I’m not sure this is necessary. Debugging comes with experience, and it can help to view it as hypothesis testing. Chapters 3 and 4 of Dietze 2017 are not covered in the summer school, but this is some good content related to handling data and scientific computing. The summer school involves a guest lecture from Steve Walker. If you are interested in best practices and learning coding, take the opportunity to ask Steve’s advice. "],["prep.html", "Preparation for students with few previous math courses", " Preparation for students with few previous math courses A Biologists Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution by Sarah P. Otto and Troy provides an excellent introduction to the development and analysis of mathematical models. This textbook can be downloaded as an ebook from many university libraries. For a student with few math courses, in preparing for the summer school, I would recommend: Chapter 2. How to construct a model. This is an excellent introduction to learning to make your own models. You should be able to solve Problems 2.1-2.6 and 2.8. Also, on this topic, you can read Chapter 1. of Keeling and Rohani, the text book for the Mathematical Epidemiology course at the summer school. Chapter 3. Deriving Classic Models in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Building your own models requires a working knowledge of the foundational models. You can omit 3.3. Problems 3.12-3.13. Primer 1. Functions and approximation. I wouldn’t read this section, but you should know that it is good reference material for understanding the shape of functions. Chapter 5. Equilibria and stability of one variable models. This is an important chapter, because ultimately you should have a mastery of Chapter 8, and Chapter 5 is foundational in that progression. The summer school models will mostly be continuous time, \\(dn(t)/dt\\) (also referred to as differential equations) rather than discrete time, \\(n(t+1)\\), (also referred to as recursion or difference equations), so if you are time-limited focus on understanding equilibrium and stability for continuous time models. Problems: 6.4a-c, 6.6, 6.8b-d, 6.9. Primer 2 Linear Algebra Again, I wouldn’t read this, but as we consider multivariable models, if you find yourself struggling, it could be necessary to study this chapter on linear algebra. Chapter 7. Equilibria and stablity analysis - linear models with multiple variables. Epidemiological models, generally, will not be linear ordinary differential equations, but nonetheless, understanding linear differential equation models is foundational to understanding non-linear models (the type that appears in the mathematical epidemiology literature). Furthermore, most non-linear models are approximated well by linear models given some restrictive assumptions. While no one desires to unnecessarily make restrictive assumptions, linear models have general solutions (details are given in Chapters 6 and 9), and that aspect of linear models is sometimes very powerful, such that linear models can be useful even if your results hold only under restrictive assumptions. Again, you want to focus your reading on continous time models. You should work towards being able to solve Problem 7.3. Chapter 8 Equilibria and Stability Analysis - nonlinear models with multiple variables. 8.1, 8.2 and 8.5 only. Problems: 8.1, 8.4a-c, 8.12. Learning mathematics requires giving yourself the time to read and think, but it is also very necessary to practice solving problems to make sure you fully understand what is written. "],["probs-2-3.html", "Problems 2.3. Characterizing uncertainty", " Problems 2.3. Characterizing uncertainty To characterize uncertainty in our ecological forecast model, we need more flexibility than the assumptions of general linear models (or ‘traditional statistical models’). What are these assumptions? [4 marks] See equation 6.1 on p81 of Ecological Forecasting describes a logistic regression. What assumption of the general linear model is not met for a logistic regression? [1 mark] Describe in words what the link function is? [1 mark] See section 6.3 starting on p83. Define process error and observation error. [2 marks] How are ‘data model’ and ‘observation error’ different? [1 mark] What is residual error (consult the index of Ecological forecasting if needed), and what point is made about residual error in section 6.3? [2 marks]   See section 6.5 starting on p90. In chapter 11, we will consider the population size, recorded over time, at different sites. Site may be considered a random effect. Explain why site could be considered a random effect? [2 marks]   Complete Task 1 of Chapter_06_FittingUncertainites.Rmd Provide a write-up of your work to complete Task 1. [20 marks] Some of the plots are large relative to a laptop figure window. While it is possible to print the figures to a folder, I found that slow because of how often you need to look at the results of the plots. I recommend completing this task as an .Rmd because it is much easier to read your plots. In your write-up, comment on whether your MCMC is meeting the standards outlined for convergence, but continue with the task even if your MCMC doesn’t meet the standards. It is more important to move through the task at a good pace, than to spend a lot of time getting a more precise result. When plotting the fitted model compared to data, note that estimated parameters are for the model which is then transformed by the link function. With a uniform prior, the code to complete this problem is summary(glm(y ~ TDR, family = \"poisson\")). How does the mean of the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates for the Bayesian analysis compare to the estimation using the frequentist method (i.e., a uniform prior)?

Have each group member play the role of a different stakeholder. Do not do the modelling to determine the values in the consequence table, instead represent these as values, \\(v_{i,j}\\). Write a paragraph describing how you applied some of the principles described in Chapter 17 of Dietze. Provide any inequalities related to the values, \\(v_{i,j}\\), you expect in the consequence table. Describe the trade-offs the consequence table reveals. Provide a simple epidemiological model that might form the deterministic skeleton for a model that could be used to estimate the values in the consequence table.

"],["behaviour-change.html", "Behaviour change in an epidemic", " Behaviour change in an epidemic Behaviour change can include social distancing uptake, wearing masks, etc (these are also called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)). NPIs can help to curb an epidemic/pandemic (i.e., flatten the curve), but behaviour change can wane over time, with pandemic fatigue, and uptake of NPI later in an epidemic can be difficult to induce in a fatigued population. Develop a mathematical model of behaviour change with fatigue. Show that fatigue can induce multiple waves of infection. How can government combat fatigue? Consider the effects of mass media messaging in changing behaviour. For more background on the topic see the this Science Table brief. "],["local-emergence-dengue.html", "Investigating the conditions for locally transmitted dengue infections", " Investigating the conditions for locally transmitted dengue infections One of the consequences of climate change is a modification of the range of many species. One preoccupying such change is the northward expansion of the range of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, two of the vectors of dengue. This has resulted in a shift, in regions where dengue was absent, from no epidemics to micro-epidemics, where one infected individual returning from a region where dengue is endemic infects several individuals in close proximity, to more sustained epidemics. The same is true with Chikungunya and might become true, in the not so distant future, with malaria. First, gather some information about this phenomenon and document a few instances where this occurred. Then, keeping this general framework in mind, write a mathematical model to describe the problem. The model will need to incorporate: - Temperature-dependent vector density, of a form you will need to determine so that vector abundances increase with one or two degree (C) of mean temperature increase. - A host population mostly naive to the pathogen. - Point introductions of the pathogen in the host population. The main question to investigate is the transition from no local epidemics to micro-epidemics to sustained local epidemics. Some ideas you may find useful: - While formulating and analysing the model in ODE is probably a good idea to get a sense of the general behaviour of the system, there is a lot to be gained by considering the continuous time Markov chain analogue. - One could even think of simulating the problem using ABMs or network models. Early outbreaks in the southern USA were often of nearby households, this could be fun to look at. "],["global-spread-SARS.html", "Simulating the global spread of SARS-CoV-2", " Simulating the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 Write an ODE metapopulation-type model to describe the global spread of a pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 between countries. You should proceed to the basic mathematical analysis of the model, in order to understand well how model parameters are likely to affect model behaviour. You will need to decide on the type of model to use: SIR, SLIR (a.k.a. SEIR), SLIAR or something else. You will also need to decide on whether to use an epidemic or an endemic model. Justify your choices. Then simulate the model with, depending on your computational resources, either a continent or the entire world. Work at the country level. Learn how to pull data regarding country population (see, e.g., this paper and its associated github repo), in order to construct movement using gravity-type weights. (You will also need to find country centroids to incorporate distances between countries.) Compare the rate of country invasions you obtain (i.e., the number of countries reporting case counts larger than some detection threshold that you will choose) with that observed in real life (see, e.g., Figure 1 here). Then modify your model to incorporate travel restrictions, both global (acting on all movement rates at the same time) or local (acting on some movement rates). It could be interesting to consider also the continuous time Markov chain analogue of your model. You could also consider a network model. "],["leprosy.html", "Leprosy and Biological Invasion", " Leprosy and Biological Invasion Armadillos can carry leprosy. With climate change, feasible habitats for armadillos can expand. Thus, areas where leprosy cases are rare can experience increases in leprosy incidence. Develop a mathematical model of armadillo movement with climate change and project the effects of armadillos on leprosy incidence in space. For more background, see this article in USA Today.

Gregory and L. Failing. Gregory and Failing’s book focuses on environmental management choices, however, best practices in decision support are also pervasive in the medical literature. Perform a systematic literature review to understand the differences and overlap between the principles of decision support that are discussed in the environmental versus epidemiological literatures. Perform a literature review to identify infectious disease modelling publications that you consider useful for decision support. Discuss how these publications conform to the principles of structured decision making discussed in Chapter 17 of Ecological Forecasting. Describe any new ideas these publications present for how to best do mathematical modelling to support decision making. Find an infectious disease model in the literature that has results that could be reformulated to better conform to the principles of structured decision making. Reproduce the infectious disease model and present the results as a consequence table, and/or calculate quantities (i.e., utility, exceedence probability, the Pareto front, etc) that are mentioned in Chapter 17 of Ecological Forecasting. You do not have to do all of these elements, however, please keep in mind that this is a math summer school, so you need to include an infectious disease model.
