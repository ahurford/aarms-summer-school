It may be helpful to first consider a two-patch model before considering a more realistic multi-patch model. You may also gain insight by trying to determine the epidemiolgical and public health response requirements for a containment strategy to be possible/beneficial. A relevant reference is The differential importation risks of COVID-19 from inbound travellers and the feasibility of targeted travel controls: A case study in Hong Kong by Yang et al (2021). You should begin by performing a literature review to identify any relevant modelling. Another version of this project would be to consider an infectious disease that impacts agriculture, such as foot-and-mouth, and to review the use of spatially-structured measures, and zones with no measures. Background In the Summer and Fall of 2020, the provinces of Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) reported few COVID-19 cases (Hurford et al. 2023). These provinces formed the Atlantic bubble, which eased COVID-19 self-isolation requirements for residents of Atlantic Canada travelling between provinces. It was announced that the Atlantic bubble would reform in the summer of 2021, but this reopening was delayed, and shortly after most of Canada’s provinces announced re-opening plans because many Canadians had now received at least one dose of vaccine. Wikipedia has a good summary of the Atlantic bubble during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the Trans-Tasman bubble was formed between Australia and New Zealand, with New Zealand proposing the traffic light system to Continue, Pause, or Suspend participation in the bubble.

If you don’t feel confident with your coding, I recommend being open to learning from a fellow summer school participant that is strong at coding - this is how many of us learned. If you want to learn more R functions, you can complete the software carpentary modules, or consult my R guide (there are other similar guides that might be better), but I’m not sure this is necessary. Debugging comes with experience, and it can help to view it as hypothesis testing. Chapters 3 and 4 of Dietze 2017 are not covered in the summer school, but this is some good content related to handling data and scientific computing.

Otto and Troy provides an excellent introduction to the development and analysis of mathematical models. This textbook can be downloaded as an ebook from many university libraries. For a student with few math courses, in preparing for the summer school, I would recommend: Chapter 2. How to construct a model. This is an excellent introduction to learning to make your own models. You should be able to solve Problems 2.1-2.6 and 2.8. Also, on this topic, you can read Chapter 1. of Keeling and Rohani, the text book for the Mathematical Epidemiology course at the summer school. Chapter 3. Deriving Classic Models in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Building your own models requires a working knowledge of the foundational models. You can omit 3.3. Problems 3.12-3.13. Primer 1. Functions and approximation. I wouldn’t read this section, but you should know that it is good reference material for understanding the shape of functions. Chapter 5. Equilibria and stability of one variable models. This is an important chapter, because ultimately you should have a mastery of Chapter 8, and Chapter 5 is foundational in that progression. The summer school models will mostly be continuous time, \\(dn(t)/dt\\) (also referred to as differential equations) rather than discrete time, \\(n(t+1)\\), (also referred to as recursion or difference equations), so if you are time-limited focus on understanding equilibrium and stability for continuous time models. Problems: 6.4a-c, 6.6, 6.8b-d, 6.9. Primer 2 Linear Algebra Again, I wouldn’t read this, but as we consider multivariable models, if you find yourself struggling, it could be necessary to study this chapter on linear algebra. Chapter 7. Equilibria and stablity analysis - linear models with multiple variables. Epidemiological models, generally, will not be linear ordinary differential equations, but nonetheless, understanding linear differential equation models is foundational to understanding non-linear models (the type that appears in the mathematical epidemiology literature). Furthermore, most non-linear models are approximated well by linear models given some restrictive assumptions. While no one desires to unnecessarily make restrictive assumptions, linear models have general solutions (details are given in Chapters 6 and 9), and that aspect of linear models is sometimes very powerful, such that linear models can be useful even if your results hold only under restrictive assumptions. Again, you want to focus your reading on continous time models. You should work towards being able to solve Problem 7.3. Chapter 8 Equilibria and Stability Analysis - nonlinear models with multiple variables. 8.1, 8.2 and 8.5 only. Problems: 8.1, 8.4a-c, 8.12. Learning mathematics requires giving yourself the time to read and think, but it is also very necessary to practice solving problems to make sure you fully understand what is written. "],["probs-2-3.html", "Problems 2.3. Characterizing uncertainty", " Problems 2.3.

While it is possible to print the figures to a folder, I found that slow because of how often you need to look at the results of the plots. I recommend completing this task as an .Rmd because it is much easier to read your plots. In your write-up, comment on whether your MCMC is meeting the standards outlined for convergence, but continue with the task even if your MCMC doesn’t meet the standards. It is more important to move through the task at a good pace, than to spend a lot of time getting a more precise result. When plotting the fitted model compared to data, note that estimated parameters are for the model which is then transformed by the link function. With a uniform prior, the code to complete this problem is summary(glm(y ~ TDR, family = \"poisson\")). How does the mean of the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates for the Bayesian analysis compare to the estimation using the frequentist method (i.e., a uniform prior)?

The process model, #### Process Model &quot;for(t in 2:n){ x[t]~dnorm(x[t-1],tau_add) }&quot; might be extended to include some epidemiological details. Rather than try to change to a very complicated model, as the first step, lets consider: \\(I_{t+1} = I_{t} + \\left(\\beta - 0.2\\right)I_t\\). This is a very simple epidemiological model, where it is assumed that the proportion of susceptible individuals is fixed and equal to 1. This assumption might hold for a short time after a novel pathogen emerges. For this model, \\(\\beta\\) is the transmission rate and the recovery rate is assumed to be estimated with complete certainty as 0.2 recoveries per day. Consider a new process model, #### Process Model &quot;for(t in 2:n){ x[t]~dnorm((1+beta_proc-0.2)*x[t-1],tau_add) }&quot; Let’s understand, that x[t] is \\(I(t)\\), and beta_proc is \\(\\beta\\). Add to the code, a prior for beta_proc. Run your code. When I tried this, it failed with the error: Error in update.jags(object, n.iter, ...) : Error in node beta_proc Current value is inconsistent with data My interpretation of the error message is that if \\(\\beta\\) is not time-varying, then there is no way that my linear recursion equation can fit the flu data, which is fluctuating. This is because the linear recursion equation will produce only geometric growth, or decay, but not both, depending on whether \\(\\beta &gt; 0.2\\) or not. Try this too. Describe all the changes that you made to the code. Report the errors that you get (or a show a graph of a fit, if you get this to work). What is the next change that you might make to this exercise to make progress on increasing the epidemiological detail, while also having a model that runs. You are to describe what you would do, but you do not have to do it.

It is also noted that this is rarely. Write a paragraph summarizing the approach that Dietz describes, and outline some of the challenges to realizing these standards for epidemiological modelling.

The exercise in Chapter_11_UncertAnalysis.Rmd shows how to partition uncertainty, using the Monte Carlo method and by adding sources of error sequentially. I am not sure how to write an if statement in JAGS, so we will separate the data into before the peak and after the peak.

PEDv does not transmit to humans and is also not transmissible to humans via food (so it is not a food-borne disease risk). PEDv is an economically important disease for agriculture. ransmission is predominantly fecal-oral and infected pigs shed large amounts of virus into their environment during the course of their infection which creates an environmental reservoir of the pathogen which can infected other animals. While a vaccine against PEDv has been used outside of Canada and has been shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality, the Canadian PEDv is a newly emerged strain for which there is no vaccine available at this time. However, new vaccine trials have shown that the PEDv vaccine in development seems to enhance disease symptoms and virus replication in vaccinated individuals.

"],["local-emergence-dengue.html", "Investigating the conditions for locally transmitted dengue infections", " Investigating the conditions for locally transmitted dengue infections One of the consequences of climate change is a modification of the range of many species. One preoccupying such change is the northward expansion of the range of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, two of the vectors of dengue. This has resulted in a shift, in regions where dengue was absent, from no epidemics to micro-epidemics, where one infected individual returning from a region where dengue is endemic infects several individuals in close proximity, to more sustained epidemics. The same is true with Chikungunya and might become true, in the not so distant future, with malaria. First, gather some information about this phenomenon and document a few instances where this occurred. Then, keeping this general framework in mind, write a mathematical model to describe the problem. The model will need to incorporate: - Temperature-dependent vector density, of a form you will need to determine so that vector abundances increase with one or two degree (C) of mean temperature increase. - A host population mostly naive to the pathogen. - Point introductions of the pathogen in the host population. The main question to investigate is the transition from no local epidemics to micro-epidemics to sustained local epidemics. Some ideas you may find useful: - While formulating and analysing the model in ODE is probably a good idea to get a sense of the general behaviour of the system, there is a lot to be gained by considering the continuous time Markov chain analogue. - One could even think of simulating the problem using ABMs or network models.

You should proceed to the basic mathematical analysis of the model, in order to understand well how model parameters are likely to affect model behaviour. You will need to decide on the type of model to use: SIR, SLIR (a.k.a. SEIR), SLIAR or something else. You will also need to decide on whether to use an epidemic or an endemic model. Justify your choices. Then simulate the model with, depending on your computational resources, either a continent or the entire world. Work at the country level. Learn how to pull data regarding country population (see, e.g., this paper and its associated github repo), in order to construct movement using gravity-type weights. (You will also need to find country centroids to incorporate distances between countries.) Compare the rate of country invasions you obtain (i.e., the number of countries reporting case counts larger than some detection threshold that you will choose) with that observed in real life (see, e.g., Figure 1 here). Then modify your model to incorporate travel restrictions, both global (acting on all movement rates at the same time) or local (acting on some movement rates). It could be interesting to consider also the continuous time Markov chain analogue of your model. You could also consider a network model.

Find an infectious disease model in the literature that has results that could be reformulated to better conform to the principles of structured decision making. Reproduce the infectious disease model and present the results as a consequence table, and/or calculate quantities (i.e., utility, exceedence probability, the Pareto front, etc) that are mentioned in Chapter 17 of Ecological Forecasting. You do not have to do all of these elements, however, please keep in mind that this is a math summer school, so you need to include an infectious disease model. "],["ticks.html", "Forecasting sampled tick abundance", " Forecasting sampled tick abundance Visit the NEON Ecological Forecasting Initiative web site and develop a model to forecast sampled tick abundance by following the instructions for the challenge. Note that this challenge occurred in 2021. Your model needs to include a complete written description of the model you develop.

Develop a model forecasting the spread of the parasite through a flock or over a region with the aim of forecasting some aspect of its impact on farming. Your report should include a discussion of your assumptions about the sources uncertainty in your forecast. One option is to focus on issues of data collection and process variability, another is to focus on the complex dynamics (e.g., a bifurcation analysis) and their role in forecast uncertainty. "],["prepstats.html", "Preparation for students with few stats courses", " Preparation for students with few stats courses The statistics covered in the Data, Models, and Decision support course focuses on bridging dynamical system models, such as those covered in Keeling and Rohani, with data. There is also an emphasis on mechanistically describing sources of uncertainty in model predictions. The topics covered in this course are statistical in nature, but the motivation and presentation is quite different from statistics courses. To prepare for the summer school, if you are inexperienced with statistics, I recommend revisiting some basic probability. For this you can read Primer 3 in A Biologists Guide to Mathematical Modeling by Sarah P. Otto and Troy Day. In addition, while it will be covered at the summer school, it might help to read Chapter 5. Introduction to Bayes in the Ecological forecasting book by Michael Dietze. Both these books are usually available for download as ebooks from university libraries.
