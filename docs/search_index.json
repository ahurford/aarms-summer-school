Two graduate-level mathematics courses will be offered from August 19 to 31, 2023. Photo credit Details Two courses will be offered: Course 1. Mathematical epidemiology, and Course 2. Data, models, and decision support. Participants will take both courses and receive a grade and certificate of completion that may be used to transfer credit to the home institution. The intended audience for the courses are math graduate students who would like to take these courses for credit. The course is also suitable for undergraduates with an interest in mathematical biology (and who have completed the relevant prerequisite coursework), and advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who are interested in working collaboratively on an innovative project to advance infectious disease modelling. Applicants should have completed undergraduate courses in mathematical modelling, dynamical systems, statistics, and be able to code in R and/or python. From August 20 to 30, 7 hours of work are planned to occur at Bonne Bay Marine Station. Participants should capitalize on being together in one location to work efficiently on projects. Due to the compressed schedule, participants will be asked to complete a problem set prior to arrival on August 19. Instructors Dr. Amy Hurford, Memorial University (Organizer, email: ahurford@mun.ca) Dr. Julien Arino, University of Manitoba Dr. Amy Greer, University of Guelph Dr. Jane Heffernan, York University Dr. James Watmough, University of New Brunswick Guest lecturers Dr. Bouchra Nasri, Universite de Montreal Dr. Steve Walker, McMaster University Dr. Brenda Wilson, Memorial University Dr. Edward Thommes, Sanofi Pasteur Getting there The summer school will be held at Bonne Bay Marine Station in Norris Point on the west coast of Newfoundland. Participants arriving from mainland Canada may wish to book flights to Deer Lake airport, or may wish to travel on the Marine Atlantic ferry to arrive in Port-aux-Basques. Rental cars are limited and should be booked well in advance. Pittmans taxi is available for transportation from Deer Lake airport to Bonne Bay Marine Station. We will also work to coordinate ground transportation to and from Deer Lake airport for participants. Funding Summer school participants will have their accommodation and meal costs covered. Accommodations will be booked for participants. Participants are responsible for organizing their own transportation to Bonne Bay Marine Station. The summer school is supported by the Atlantic Association for Research in the Mathematical Sciences, Mathematics for Public Health, the Canadian Network for Modelling Infectious Diseases, the One Health Modelling Network for Emerging Infections, Memorial University, and the Canadian Centre for Disease Modelling.

Data, models, and decision support Mathematical models provide decision support through forecasting, describing unrealized past outcomes (counterfactuals), and in communication. This course will teach the technical skills to parameterize dynamical systems models in ecology and evolution, and quantify prediction uncertainty. The course will examine case studies to understand the use of models in decision support. This course is based on Ecological Forecasting by Michael Dietze.

"],["prepcoding.html", "Preparation for students with limited coding experience", " Preparation for students with limited coding experience Coding involves some knowledge of specific languages (for the summer school this is R), however the most important coding skill is having a good idea for how to do what you want to do (i.e., writing pseudo-code), having experience solving similar problems (the summer school aims to give you this experience for your own future research), and being skilled at debugging. If you don’t feel confident with your coding, I recommend being open to learning from a fellow summer school participant that is strong at coding - this is how many of us learned. If you want to learn more R functions, you can complete the software carpentary modules, or consult my R guide (there are other similar guides that might be better), but I’m not sure this is necessary. Debugging comes with experience, and it can help to view it as hypothesis testing. Chapters 3 and 4 of Dietze 2017 are not covered in the summer school, but this is some good content related to handling data and scientific computing. The summer school involves a guest lecture from Steve Walker. If you are interested in best practices and learning coding, take the opportunity to ask Steve’s advice. "],["prep.html", "Preparation for students with few previous math courses", " Preparation for students with few previous math courses A Biologists Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution by Sarah P. Otto and Troy provides an excellent introduction to the development and analysis of mathematical models. This textbook can be downloaded as an ebook from many university libraries. For a student with few math courses, in preparing for the summer school, I would recommend: Chapter 2. How to construct a model. This is an excellent introduction to learning to make your own models. You should be able to solve Problems 2.1-2.6 and 2.8. Also, on this topic, you can read Chapter 1. of Keeling and Rohani, the text book for the Mathematical Epidemiology course at the summer school. Chapter 3. Deriving Classic Models in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Building your own models requires a working knowledge of the foundational models. You can omit 3.3. Problems 3.12-3.13. Primer 1. Functions and approximation. I wouldn’t read this section, but you should know that it is good reference material for understanding the shape of functions. Chapter 5. Equilibria and stability of one variable models. This is an important chapter, because ultimately you should have a mastery of Chapter 8, and Chapter 5 is foundational in that progression. The summer school models will mostly be continuous time, \\(dn(t)/dt\\) (also referred to as differential equations) rather than discrete time, \\(n(t+1)\\), (also referred to as recursion or difference equations), so if you are time-limited focus on understanding equilibrium and stability for continuous time models. Problems: 6.4a-c, 6.6, 6.8b-d, 6.9. Primer 2 Linear Algebra Again, I wouldn’t read this, but as we consider multivariable models, if you find yourself struggling, it could be necessary to study this chapter on linear algebra. Chapter 7. Equilibria and stablity analysis - linear models with multiple variables. Epidemiological models, generally, will not be linear ordinary differential equations, but nonetheless, understanding linear differential equation models is foundational to understanding non-linear models (the type that appears in the mathematical epidemiology literature). Furthermore, most non-linear models are approximated well by linear models given some restrictive assumptions. While no one desires to unnecessarily make restrictive assumptions, linear models have general solutions (details are given in Chapters 6 and 9), and that aspect of linear models is sometimes very powerful, such that linear models can be useful even if your results hold only under restrictive assumptions. Again, you want to focus your reading on continous time models. You should work towards being able to solve Problem 7.3. Chapter 8 Equilibria and Stability Analysis - nonlinear models with multiple variables. 8.1, 8.2 and 8.5 only. Problems: 8.1, 8.4a-c, 8.12. Learning mathematics requires giving yourself the time to read and think, but it is also very necessary to practice solving problems to make sure you fully understand what is written. "],["prepstats.html", "Preparation for students with few stats courses", " Preparation for students with few stats courses The statistics covered in the Data, Models, and Decision support course focuses on bridging dynamical system models, such as those covered in Keeling and Rohani, with data. There is also an emphasis on mechanistically describing sources of uncertainty in model predictions. The topics covered in this course are statistical in nature, but the motivation and presentation is quite different from statistics courses. To prepare for the summer school, if you are inexperienced with statistics, I recommend revisiting some basic probability. For this you can read Primer 3 in A Biologists Guide to Mathematical Modeling by Sarah P. Otto and Troy Day. In addition, while it will be covered at the summer school, it might help to read Chapter 4. Introduction to Bayes in the Ecological forecasting book by Michael Dietze. Both these books are usually available for download as ebooks from university libraries.
