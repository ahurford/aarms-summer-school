[["index.html", "1 2023 EIDM-AARMS Summer School 1.1 Schedule", " 1 2023 EIDM-AARMS Summer School Two courses are offered for math graduate credit: Mathematical Epidemiology (Math Epi), and Data, models, and decision support. It is intended that participants will take both courses. 30 hours of instruction is considered to be equivalent to a grad course. A pre-requisite problem set will be assigned. Covers preliminaries in dynamical systems, epidemiology, and modelling. Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project. Ideas for project descriptions will be provided. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19. 7 hours of work is planned each day, expected to occur between 8.30am and 5.30pm with exact times to be determined. Students should also captize on being together to work on their projects if they wish, during down hours. 1.1 Schedule Saturday August 19: arrive (if staying at BBMS check-in is ???)

Compartmental model assumptions (approximations: GillespieSSA pair approximation). Agent-based models vs. branching processes. Limitations of different approaches. Problems 1. Explain what is meant by ‘all models are wrong but some are useful’ with an example of a model that is useful. Are models that are useful wrong in different ways than models that are not useful?
