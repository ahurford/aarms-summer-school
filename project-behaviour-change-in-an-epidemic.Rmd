Behaviour change can include social distancing uptake, wearing masks, etc (these are also called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)). NPIs can help to curb an epidemic/pandemic (i.e., flatten the curve), but behaviour change can wane over time, with pandemic fatigue, and uptake of NPI later in an epidemic can be difficult to induce in a fatigued population. Develop a mathematical model of behaviour change with fatigue. Show that fatigue can induce multiple waves of infection. How can government combat fatigue?? Consider the effects of mass media messaging in changing behaviour.
