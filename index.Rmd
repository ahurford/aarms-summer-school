## Details {-}

Two courses will be offered:

- [Course 1.](#course1) Mathematical epidemiology, and

- [Course 2.](#course2) Data, models, and decision support.

Participants will take both courses.

A pre-requisite problem set will be assigned to be submitted by August 19. This problem set will cover preliminaries in dynamical systems, epidemiology, and modelling.

From August 20 to 30, 7 hours of work are planned to occur at [Bonne Bay Marine Station](https://grenfell.mun.ca/academics-and-research/Pages/Bonne-Bay-Marine-Station.aspx). Participants should capitalize on being together in one location to work efficiently on projects.
