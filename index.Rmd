# 2023 AARMS-EIDM Summer School

## Application form
To apply for the summer school you must complete this [form](https://forms.gle/DcWMnRJtnNFKXMar6) by April 1, 2023.

## Details

The AARMS-EIDM Summer School will be held from August 19 - 31, 2023 at Bonne Bay Marine Research Station in Norris Point, Newfoundland. 

Two courses will be offered for math graduate credit:

- Course 1. Mathematical epidemiology, and

- Course 2. Data, models, and decision support.

Participants will take both courses.

A pre-requisite problem set will be assigned to be submitted by August 19. This problem set will cover the preliminaries in dynamical systems, epidemiology, and modelling.

Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project (1 project for both courses). Ideas for project descriptions will be provided by the instructors. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19. 

Between the two courses, 7 hours of work is planned each day, expected to occur between 8.30am and 5.30pm with exact times to be determined. Students should also capitalize on being together to work on their projects if they wish, during unscheduled hours. The summer school will feature 3 guest lecturers.
