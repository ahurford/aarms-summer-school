# Course 2. Data, models, and decision support {-}

During the COVID-19 pandemic mathematical modelling provided decision support through forecast modelling, exploration of counter-factual scenarios, and in guiding communication. This course will teach the technical skills to estimate model parameters, fit models to data, and describe the uncertainty of predictions. We will explore the use of models in public health communications during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how models can best provide decision support. Some lectures will be from [Ecological forecasting](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160573/ecological-forecasting).

- Lecture 1.  What is a model? What are models used for? (conceptual, mechanistic, statistical; forecasting and counter-factuals). Chapter 1 of Otto and Day? Other references?). Compartmental model assumptions (approximations: GillespieSSA pair approximation). Agent-based models vs. branching processes. Limitations of different approaches. (Heffernan)

- Lecture 2. Parameter estimation (i,e., independent parameter estimation; rate parameters as reciprocals of mean time, types of data available), model selection for mechanistic models. (Watmough)
