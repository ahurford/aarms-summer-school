  + a presentation of your project that you upload to a website;
  + software (i.e., hosted on github) or a dataset;
  + a web app (i.e., R Shiny);
  + a website aimed to communicate your results to the public;
  + you may indicate that you plan to continue working on your project and publish it as a pre-print and submit it for peer-review;

* You must also complete a written project so that we can evaluate the technical details of your work.
