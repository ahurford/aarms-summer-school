# Course 2. Data, models, and decision support {-}

During the COVID-19 pandemic mathematical modelling provided decision support through forecast modelling and counterfactuals. This course will cover parameter estimation, model fitting, uncertainty quantification, and decision support in epidemiolgical modelling. Some lectures will be from [Ecological forecasting](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160573/ecological-forecasting).

- Lecture 1.  What is a model? What are models used for? (conceptual, mechanistic, statistical; strengths of each; forecasting and counterfactuals; model selection. Chapter 1 of Otto and Day? Other references?). Compartmental model assumptions (approximations: GillespieSSA pair approximation). Agent-based models vs. branching processes. Limitations of different approaches. (Heffernan)

- Lecture 2. Parameter estimation (i,e., independent parameter estimation - rate parameters as reciprocals of mean time from literature), model selection for mechanistic models, doing counter-factuals. (Watmough)

**Problems 1. See [here](#course2-problems1)**

- Lectures 3. & 4. Ch 2. Process error vs. observation error (and Ch. 6.1 and 6.2 of [Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals](http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/)) (Watmough)

**Problems 2. [Exercise 2 from Ecological forecasting](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_02_Logistic.Rmd)**

- Lectures 5. & 6.  Ch 5. Introduction to Bayes (Hurford)

**Problems 3. [Exercise 5 - Just Another Gibbs Sampler](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_05_JAGS.Rmd)**

- Lectures 7. & 8. Ch 6. Uncertainty (Watmough)

**Problems 4. [Chapter 6 Fitting uncertainties](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Chapter_06_FittingUncertainties.Rmd)**

- Lectures 9. & 10. Ch 8. Latent variables. This [reference](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/fee.2530) is interesting. (Arino)

**Problems 5. [Exercise 6 from Ecological forecasting](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_06_StateSpace.Rmd)**

- Lectures 11. & 12. Ch. 11 Uncertainty (Hurford)

**Problems 6. [Chapter 11](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_ActivitiesChap)**

- Lectures 13 & 14. TBD Ch. 13, 14, or 16 in Ecological forecasting. (Watmough)

**Problems 7. TBD**

- Lecture 15. Models for decision support. Ch 17. Forecasting models for decision support. Toy models for communication for decision support, ex. COVID-19: flatten the curve, $R_0$, $R_t$, doubling time, herd immunity, total mortality for highly transmissible variants. Counterfactuals for decision support. Case studies (i.e., see Ecological Forecasting book) (Hurford)

**Problems 8. Critical review of COVID-19 models for decision support or see [here](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_ActivitiesChap) and [here](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_ActivitiesChap)**
