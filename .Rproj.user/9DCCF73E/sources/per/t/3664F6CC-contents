# Course 1. Mathematical Epidemiology {-}

This course will cover different formulations and analyses for mathematical models in epidemiology. Topics include host heterogeneity, multiple pathogens, seasonality, spatial spread, within-host dynamics, and zoonotic spillover. Some lectures will be based on [Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals](http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/) by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani (available as .pdf from MUN library).
