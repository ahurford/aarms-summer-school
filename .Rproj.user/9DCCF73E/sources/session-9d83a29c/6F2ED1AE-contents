**The AARMS-EIDM Summer School took place at [Bonne Bay Marine Station](https://grenfell.mun.ca/academics-and-research/Pages/Bonne-Bay-Marine-Station.aspx), located in Norris Point on the west coast of Newfoundland.** Two graduate-level mathematics courses were offered from August 19 to 31, 2023.

To learn more about the summer school, here is an interview with Bernice Hillier on [CBC Newfoundland Morning](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-210-cbc-newfoundland-morning/clip/16006442-making-sure-were-ready-track-next-disease-concern.).

<!-- ## Details {-} -->

<!-- Two courses will be offered: -->

<!-- - [Course 1.](#course1) Mathematical epidemiology, and -->

<!-- - [Course 2.](#course2) Data, models, and decision support. -->

<!-- Participants will take both courses and receive a grade and certificate of completion that may be used to transfer credit to the home institution. The intended audience for the courses are math graduate students who would like to take these courses for credit. The course is also suitable for undergraduates with an interest in mathematical biology (and who have completed the relevant prerequisite coursework), and advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who are interested in working collaboratively on an innovative project to advance infectious disease modelling. -->

<!-- Applicants should have completed undergraduate courses in mathematical modelling, dynamical systems, statistics, and be able to code in R and/or python. -->

<!-- From August 20 to 30, 7 hours of work are planned to occur at [Bonne Bay Marine Station](https://grenfell.mun.ca/academics-and-research/Pages/Bonne-Bay-Marine-Station.aspx). Participants should capitalize on being together in one location to work efficiently on projects. Due to the compressed schedule, participants will be asked to complete a problem set prior to arrival on August 19. -->

<!-- ## Getting there {-} -->

<!-- The summer school will be held at [Bonne Bay Marine Station](https://grenfell.mun.ca/academics-and-research/Pages/Bonne-Bay-Marine-Station.aspx) in Norris Point on the west coast of Newfoundland. -->

<!-- - Participants arriving from mainland Canada may wish to book flights to Deer Lake airport, or may wish to travel on the Marine Atlantic ferry to arrive in Port-aux-Basques. -->

<!-- - Rental cars are limited and should be booked well in advance. -->

<!-- - Pittmans taxi is available for transportation from Deer Lake airport to Bonne Bay Marine Station. We will also work to coordinate ground transportation to and from Deer Lake airport for participants. -->
