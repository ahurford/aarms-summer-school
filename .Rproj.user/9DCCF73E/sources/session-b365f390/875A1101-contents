# Problems 2.5. Characterizing uncertainty {.unlisted .unnumbered #probs-2-5}

The models presented in the [Hurford and Watmough (2021)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85053-1_11) book chapter do not contain any description of uncertainty. However, unlike [Problems 2.4](#probs-2-4) the model in Hurford and Watmough (2021) does have a similar shape to the data and the parameters have been estimated using maximum likelihood (which may be helpful to informing priors).

The exercise in [Chapter_11_UncertAnalysis.Rmd](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Chapter_11_UncertAnalysis.Rmd) shows how to partition uncertainty, using the Monte Carlo method and by adding sources of error sequentially.

I am not sure how to write an `if` statement in _JAGS_, so we will separate the data into _before_ the peak and _after_ the peak. The [data](https://github.com/ahurford/reescalation-chapter) needed for this exercise can be found here: [https://github.com/ahurford/reescalation-chapter](https://github.com/ahurford/reescalation-chapter).

Run [Chapter_11_UncertAnalysis.Rmd](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Chapter_11_UncertAnalysis.Rmd). To the [Hurford and Watmough (2021)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85053-1_11) model (equation 2) sequentially add the following sources of error:

  + Intial condition error;
  + Parameter estimation error;
  + Process error, whereby $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are Poisson-distributed, and where $\lambda_i = \beta_i - \gamma$.
  
You are to defined your own priors, and produce a figure similar to the one below (from [Chapter_11_UncertAnalysis.Rmd](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Chapter_11_UncertAnalysis.Rmd)), but with just the sources of uncertainty described above.
