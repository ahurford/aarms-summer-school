## Applications {-}
<div class="alert alert-info">

</div>

## Details {-}

Two courses will be offered for math graduate credit:

- [Course 1.](#course1) Mathematical epidemiology, and

- [Course 2.](#course2) Data, models, and decision support.

Participants will take both courses.

A pre-requisite problem set will be assigned to be submitted by August 19. This problem set will cover the preliminaries in dynamical systems, epidemiology, and modelling.

Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project (1 project for both courses). Ideas for project descriptions will be provided by the instructors. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19. 

Between the two courses, 7 hours of work is planned each day, expected to occur between 8.30am and 5.30pm with exact times to be determined. Students should also capitalize on being together to work on their projects if they wish, during unscheduled hours. The summer school will feature 3 guest lecturers.

# Course 2. Data, models, and decision support {-}

During the COVID-19 pandemic mathematical modelling provided decision support through forecast modelling, exploration of counter-factual scenarios, and in guiding communication. This course will teach the technical skills to estimate model parameters, fit models to data, and describe the uncertainty of predictions. We will explore the use of models in public health communications during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how models can best provide decision support. Some lectures will be from [Ecological forecasting](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160573/ecological-forecasting).

- Lecture 1.  What is a model? What are models used for? (conceptual, mechanistic, statistical; forecasting and counter-factuals). Chapter 1 of Otto and Day? Other references?). Compartmental model assumptions (approximations: GillespieSSA pair approximation). Agent-based models vs. branching processes. Limitations of different approaches. (Heffernan)

- Lecture 2. Parameter estimation (i,e., independent parameter estimation; rate parameters as reciprocals of mean time, types of data available), model selection for mechanistic models. (Watmough)

**Problems 1. See [here](#course2-problems1)**

- Lectures 7. & 8. Ch 6. Uncertainty (Watmough)

**Problems 4. [Chapter 6 Fitting uncertainties](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Chapter_06_FittingUncertainties.Rmd)**

- Lectures 9. & 10. Ch 8. Latent variables. This [reference](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/fee.2530) is interesting. (Arino)

**Problems 5. [Exercise 6 from Ecological forecasting](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_06_StateSpace.Rmd)**

# Problems {-}

## Course 2. Problems 1. {#course2-problems1 .unlisted .unnumbered}

Write 3-4 paragraphs or ~1 page (if including a figure and/or list of selected references.) Address some of these topics:

 - 'All models are wrong but some are useful'. Given an example of a model that is useful.
 
 - Identify ways in which models that are useful are wrong in different ways than models that are not useful.
 
 - Define model, topic, and question.

- Review data sources available for epidemiological modelling.

- How does data availability and computational limitations affect determinations of whether models are _wrong?_

- Give a list of relevant references. Draw a conceptual diagram to illustrate your ideas.**
