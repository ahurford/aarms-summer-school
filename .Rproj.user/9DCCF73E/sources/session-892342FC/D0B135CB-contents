# Getting there {-}

The summer school will be held at [Bonne Bay Marine Station](https://grenfell.mun.ca/academics-and-research/Pages/Bonne-Bay-Marine-Station.aspx) in Norris Point on the west coast of Newfoundland.

- Participants arriving from mainland Canada may wish to book flights to Deer Lake airport, or may wish to travel on the Marine Atlantic ferry to arrive in Port-aux-Basques.

- Rental cars are limited and should be booked well in advance.

- Pittmans taxi is available for transportation from Deer Lake airport to Bonne Bay Marine Station. We will also work to coordinate ground transportation from airport for participants.
