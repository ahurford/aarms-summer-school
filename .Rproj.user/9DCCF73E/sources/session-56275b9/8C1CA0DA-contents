# Course 2. Data, models, and decision support {#course2 .unnumbered}

Mathematical models provide decision support through forecasting, describing unrealized past outcomes (counterfactuals), and in communication. This course will teach the technical skills to parameterize dynamical systems models in ecology and evolution, and quantify prediction uncertainty. The course will examine case studies to understand the use of models in decision support.
