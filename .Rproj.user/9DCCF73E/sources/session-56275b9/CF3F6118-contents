# Course 1. Mathematical Epidemiology {#course1 .unnumbered}

This course will cover different formulations and analyses of epidemiological models. Topics include host heterogeneity, multiple pathogens, spatial spread, within-host dynamics, and zoonotic spillover. Some lectures will be based on [Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals](http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/) by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani.
