# Course 1. Mathematical Epidemiology {#course1 .unnumbered}

This course will cover different formulations and analyses of epidemiological models. Topics include host heterogeneity, multiple pathogens, spatial spread, within-host dynamics, and zoonotic spillover. Some lectures will be based on [Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals](http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/) by Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani.


[Course outline (downloadable .pdf)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahurford/aarms-summer-school/main/docs/Mathematical%20Epidemiology%20v2.pdf)

AARMS Summer School format:

- 1 problem set to be completed before arrival
- 15 lectures (15 hours)
- 2 guest lectures (2 hours)
- In-class exercises/group work (18 hours)

Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project. Project descriptions will be provided by the instructors. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19. 

<!--chapter:end:01-course-1.Rmd-->

# Course 2. Data, models, and decision support {#course2 .unnumbered}

Mathematical models provide decision support through forecasting, describing unrealized past outcomes (counterfactuals), and in communication. This course will teach the technical skills to parameterize dynamical systems models in ecology and evolution, and quantify prediction uncertainty. The course will examine case studies to understand the use of models in decision support.

# Getting there {-}

The summer school will be held at [Bonne Bay Marine Station](https://grenfell.mun.ca/academics-and-research/Pages/Bonne-Bay-Marine-Station.aspx) in Norris Point on the west coast of Newfoundland.

- Participants arriving from mainland Canada may wish to book flights to Deer Lake airport, or may wish to travel on the Marine Atlantic ferry to arrive in Port-aux-Basques.

- Rental cars are limited and should be booked well in advance.

- Pittmans taxi is available for transportation from Deer Lake airport to Bonne Bay Marine Station. We will also work to coordinate ground transportation to and from Deer Lake airport for participants.
