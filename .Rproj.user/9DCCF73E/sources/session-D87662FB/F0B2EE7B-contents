# Course 2. Data, models, and decision support {-}

Mathematical modelling best provides decision support when scientists are able to effectively communicate the data support for their recommendations. This involves understanding the models most appropriate for given questions, model assumptions, and communicating uncertainty. This course will cover types of models and what models can be used for, model parameterization and assumptions, forecasting, and model evaluation. We will explore case studies where modelling has informed decision support. Some lectures will be from [Ecological forecasting](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691160573/ecological-forecasting).

- Lecture 1.  What is a model? What are models used for? (conceptual, mechanistic, statistical; strengths of each; forecasting and counterfactuals. Chapter 1 of Otto and Day? Other references?). Compartmental model assumptions (approximations: GillespieSSA pair approximation). Agent-based models vs. branching processes. Limitations of different approaches.

- Lecture 2. Parameter estimation (i,e., independent parameter estimation - rate parameters as reciprocals of mean time) and working with data. (See also Ch 3. of Dietze and [Exercise 3](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_03_BigData.Rmd))

**Problems 1. See [here](#course2-problems1)**

- Lectures 3. & 4. Ch 2. Process error vs. observation error (and Ch. 6.1 and 6.2 of [Modelling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals](http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/))

**Problems 2. [Exercise 2 from Ecological forecasting](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_02_Logistic.Rmd)**

- Lectures 5. & 6.  Ch 5. Introduction to Bayes

**Problems 3. [Exercise 5 - Just Another Gibbs Sampler](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_05_JAGS.Rmd)**

- Lectures 7. & 8. Ch 6. Uncertainty

**Problems 4. [Chapter 6 Fitting uncertainties](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Chapter_06_FittingUncertainties.Rmd)**

- Lectures 9. & 10. Ch 8. Latent variables. This [reference](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/fee.2530) is interesting.

- Lectures 13 & 14. TBD Ch. 13, 14, or 16 in Ecological forecasting. 

**Problems 7. TBD**

- Lecture 15. Ch 17. Forecasting models for decision support. Toy models for communication for decision support, ex. COVID-19: flatten the curve, $R_0$, $R_t$, doubling time, herd immunity, total mortality for highly transmissible variants. Counterfactuals for decision support. Case studies (i.e., see Ecological Forecasting book)
