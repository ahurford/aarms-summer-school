# Problems 2.7 Assessing Model Performance {.unlisted .unnumbered #probs-2-7}

1. Rework [problem 2.4](probs-2-4) exercise 2, but restrict the data to a single year.  For example, just use data after August 1st, 2014.
```{r}
gflu = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/master/data/gflu_data.txt",skip=11)
time = as.Date(gflu$Date)
y = gflu$Massachusetts

yobs = y[time > "2014-08-01"]
tobs = time[time > "2014-08-01"]
plot(tobs,yobs)
```
Create various visualizations to assess model performance as per the suggestions in Dietz, chapter 16.  As a minimum, (1) plot the mean model output along with the observed cases vs time, (2) plot observed vs predicted (mean) and compute the correlation $R^2$, and (3) plot the residuals (observed less predicted) vs both time and predicted. Comment on the results.

2. (optional) Create visualizations and compute descriptive statistics to assess the model of [problem 2.5](probs-2-5) or any model used in any other problem sets in the school (I.e., pick your favourite model and assess it).
