\question[10]
Consider the Kermack-McKendrick SIR \emph{epidemic} model
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[auto,
        cloud/.style={minimum width={width("-12")+2pt},
            draw, ellipse},
        connected/.style={dotted,-}]
        %% Vertices
        \node [cloud] at (0,0) (S) {$S$};
        \node [cloud] at (2,0) (I){$I$};
        \node [cloud] at (4,0) (R){$R$};
        %% Arcs
        \path [line, thick] (S) to node [midway, above] (TextNode) {$\beta SI$} (I);
        \path [line, thick] (I) to node [midway, above] (TextNode) {$\gamma I$} (R);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
and the \emph{endemic} SIR model with demography
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[auto,
        cloud/.style={minimum width={width("-12")+2pt},
            draw, ellipse},
        connected/.style={dotted,-}]
        %% Vertices
        \node [cloud] at (0,0) (S) {$S$};
        \node [cloud] at (2,0) (I){$I$};
        \node [cloud] at (4,0) (R){$R$};
        %% Arcs
        \path [line, thick] (-1.5,0) to node [midway, above] (TextNode) {$b$} (S);
        \path [line, thick] (S) to node [midway, above] (TextNode) {$\beta SI$} (I);
        \path [line, thick] (S) to node [midway, left] (TextNode) {$dS$} (0,-1.5);
        \path [line, thick] (I) to node [midway, above] (TextNode) {$\gamma I$} (R);
        \path [line, thick] (I) to node [midway, left] (TextNode) {$dI$} (2,-1.5);
        \path [line, thick] (R) to node [midway, left] (TextNode) {$dR$} (4,-1.5);

\begin{parts}
    \part Write simple, $|\mathcal{P}|$-metapopulation models based on each model, using explicit movement as well as implicit coupling. The latter means that coupling is \emph{not} through the movement of individuals between locations, but through the incidence function, i.e., mass action incidence in patch $p$ takes the form
    \[
        S_p\left(\sum_{q\in\mathcal{P}}\beta_{qp}I_q\right),
    \]
    with $\beta_{qp}$ the contact parameter (``influence'') of infectious individuals in patch $q$ on susceptible individuals in patch $p$.
    \part From now on, consider only the two models with explicit movement. Compute the DFE (beware in the case of the epidemic model) and $\mathcal{R}_0$.
    \part In the endemic case, it is easy to compute the endemic equilibrium in the single population case, by writing the equation for the dynamics of $I(t)$ as
    \[
        I' = \left(\beta S-(\gamma+d)\right)I.
    \]
    Does this work in the metapopulation case? Why/why not?
    \part Modifying the code I gave in the CODE directory, write code to simulate both systems.
    \part Write code to simulate both systems as continuous-time Markov chains in a two-patch situation.
    \part (Bonus) Write code to simulate the models as CTMC in the case of an arbitrary number of patches.
    \part Investigate introductions in the two-patch context, by using the capacity of {\tt ssa} in {\tt GillespieSSA2} to return events.
