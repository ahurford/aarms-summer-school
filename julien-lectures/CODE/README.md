# CODE directory

This directory will contain code for my lectures. 

For convenience, I am including here all the code from the relevant chapters in [Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals](http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/), by Keeling and Rohani. Refer to the book and that website for details (and the website for the latest version of the code).
