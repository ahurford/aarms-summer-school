# Course 2. Data, models, and decision support {#course2 .unnumbered}

Mathematical models provide decision support through forecasting, describing unrealized past outcomes (counterfactuals), and in communication. This course will teach the technical skills to parameterize dynamical systems models in ecology and evolution, and quantify prediction uncertainty. The course will examine case studies to understand the use of models in decision support.

AARMS Summer School format:

- 1 problem set to be completed prior to arrival
- 15 lectures (15 hours)
- 1 guest lecture (1 hour)
- In-class exercises/group work (19 hours)

Students will work in groups of 2-3 to complete a project. Project descriptions will be provided by the instructors. Specific expertise of the instructors includes spatial epidemiology, importations, within-host models, zoonotic spillover, and COVID-19.
